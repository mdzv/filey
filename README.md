## Description
So I made something different here, this is a program that I tested out to see how files can be logged after being moved, deleted, created or modified. You can use this anywhere and for any directory or folder.

## Features
Monitor files to see which have been created, modified, moved or deleted.

## Installation
Download the `filey.py` file, copy and paste the code or copy the repo.

## Usage
You can just run `python filey.py` to start the program, and the `esc` button to stop it.
